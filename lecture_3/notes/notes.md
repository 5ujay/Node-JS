Connect mongodb with nodejs / application :

To connect the mongo db with the node js we need the mongodb driver
a mongodb driver is essential when connecting nodejs with mongodb bcz it acts as a bridge between your nodejs application and the mongodb database

The driver translate js code from nodejs into a format that mongodb can understand and vise versa.

Mongoose is a popular Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB that simplifies working with MongoDB in Node.js applications. It acts as a layer between your application code and the MongoDB database, providing a structured way to define your data models and interact with the database
